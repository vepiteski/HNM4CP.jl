# HNM4CP

[![Build Status](https://github.com/vepiteski/HNM4CP.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/vepiteski/HNM4CP.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

In construction. Will provide a Hybrid Newton-Min solver for complementarity problems. Next step, provide the solver for LCPs.

First test incorporated.

For now, no easy way to use this package.

In the REPL, type
      "]" to enter the Package manager subshell.
Then, type
      dev https://github.com/vepiteski/HNM4CP.jl

This should install the package. Still in the Pkg subshell, type in
      test HNM4CP
this should trigger tests, hopefully successful.

Then, inspect the folder Test to imitate the test scripts to use the HNM solver.


Much more and much clearer instructions are in preparation!!!
